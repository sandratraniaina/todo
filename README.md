# To-Do List App (React + Vite)

This is a simple React application built with Vite to help you learn key React concepts while managing your tasks.  It allows you to:

* Create new to-do items with descriptions.
* Mark tasks as completed or revert them back to active.
* Archive completed tasks for a cleaner view.
* Delete tasks you no longer need.
* Persist your to-do list in the browser's local storage.
